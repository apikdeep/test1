                My love, you are truly the most beautiful gift that life has bestowed upon me. You mean everything to me, and I can’t imagine my life without you. I know I’m not perfect, and I struggle with allowing you the freedom to hang out with your friends or talk to other guys. This comes from a place of deep pain and loss in my past; I’ve lost so many people who mattered to me.

                You are my last love, my hope, and the one person who genuinely cares for me. The thought of losing you terrifies me, and that’s why I find myself being protective. I hope you understand that my love for you drives this instinct. You are my everything, and I cherish you more than words can express.
